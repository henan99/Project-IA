As first model to acquire better results than with the native model we 
chose the logistic regression. We used the class LogisticRegressionCV 
from the library sklearn.linear_model which permitted us to vary the 
regulation parameter in order the finde the one with gives us the best results.

For the best model we find the regularisation parmater $C \approx 8$ which gives
us the following results:

\begin{align}
    \text{accuracy}\approx 97.7\%\\
    \text{recall}\approx 80.7\%\\
    \text{precision} \approx 0.92.4\%
\end{align}
